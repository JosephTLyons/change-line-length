# change-line-length
An [Atom](https://atom.io) text editor package that lets you cycle through
different user-defined Preferred Line Length settings.

## TODO:
- [ ] Remove bugginess, fix error sound when using commands
- [ ] Find a way to discreetly store the current index adjustment instead of
using package settings
- [ ] Present array for user to insert in settings (Settings UI for array?)
- [ ] Visual pop-up of new value?
